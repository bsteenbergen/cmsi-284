1. A "computer system" is a set of different layers with each working on the one below it.

2. Some parts of the computer system are the CPU (control porcessing unit), the digital logic
    (hardware) and the control layer.

3. The difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language is for an interpreted
    language an interpretor is needed to run and excecute the program, and in the compiled language
    the program is directly translated.

4. No, C is not a compiled language becuase we have to use the gcc (or some other compiler) in 
    order to compile it.

5. Dennis Ritchie invented the C language while working at Bell labs. Found at 
    https://cs.brown.edu/~adf/programming_languages.html.

6. C has been in use since it was created in 1972. Found at 
    https://cs.brown.edu/~adf/programming_languages.html.

7. Yes, a compiler is a translator because it turns the code from source code into assembly code.

8. Yes, an assembler is a translator because it turns the assembly code in to machine code.

9. ls is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac.

10. The C function atof() converts a string into a double and returns that value. Found at 
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/atol-atoll-and-atof-functions-in-c-c/.

11. The bottom two layers of a computer system are digital logic and the control layer. The digital
    logic layer is the hardware that all the operators run on and the control layer contains the 
    microcode that interprets the layer below it.

12. The three steps of the Von Neumann architecture are the CPU, memory and input/output.

13. An ALU is the part of the CPU that performs the computations done on integers.

14. A register is a special (fast) type of memory in the CPU where bit patterns get stored, 
    manipulated and operated on.

15. One difference between applications software and systems software is that apllications is 
    written for people and systems is written for computers.

16. No, the commands cmp, rdi and rsi are assembly language, not machine language.

17. There are 3 buses in the system bus: the data bus, the address bus and the control bus.

18. 151 is the decimal value of the binary number 10010111.

19. 255 is the decimal value of the binary number 11111111.

20. The largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits is 2^16 - 1 or 65,535. Found at
